This project provides details for how to build an Arduino-based piano logger - it logs every key press on a MIDI keyboard. The device does not measure any other input (i.e., no microphone or other sensors). The files are saved to a CSV file

The project consists of:
1. [Parts list](PartsList.md) - a list of parts needed for the project
2. STL and openSCAD files for the 3D needed for the box
3. Arduino code
4. [Construction instructions](constructionInstructions.md)
